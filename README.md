# Event Adapter

EVA is the Event Adapter. It is an event-driven daemon, which processes data
sets based on metadata updates from a Productstatus service.

Extensive documentation is available in reStructuredText format in the `doc/`
directory. You may view the HTML version online at http://it.met.no/EVA/, or
you can build it yourself by running `make doc`.
