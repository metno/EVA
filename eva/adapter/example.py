    Example adapter, good for starting out writing EVA jobs.

    This adapter serves as a reusable example of how to write your own EVA jobs.

    To run this adapter on GridEngine, you might want to configure these environment variables:

    .. code-block:: ini

       [executor.gridengine]
       class = eva.executor.GridEngineExecutor
       ssh_host = <gridengine-login-node>
       ssh_key_file = /home/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa
       ssh_user = <username>

       [adapter.example]
       class = eva.adapter.example.ExampleAdapter
       executor = executor.gridengine
       input_data_format = netcdf
       input_product = ecmwf-atmospheric-model-bc-surface
       input_service_backend = lustre-b
       output_filename_pattern = {{reference_time|timedelta(hours=6)|iso8601_compact}}

    Then, run EVA:

    .. code-block:: bash

       python -m eva --process_data_instance <data-instance-uuid>

    #     a job was not generated. The job will not be sent to the adapter
    #     again for further processing.
    #
    #   * Raise `eva.exceptions.RetryException` with an error message. The
    #     error message will appear in the log. In production, this log will be
    #     recorded and is searchable. Processing will be delayed by a short
    #     interval, then retried.
    #
    #   * Any other exception will result in a termination of EVA.
